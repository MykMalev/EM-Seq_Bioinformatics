# EM-Seq_Bioinformatics
This repository contains code used in computational analysis of EM-Seq converted Illumina sequencing data.
BWAmethPipeline and BismarkPipeline is a full workflow that produces mapped reads and extracts methylation information from raw reads.
Conversion_Rates determines the efficiency of EM-Seq conversion based on the control DNA used during library preparation.
DAMEfinder scripts are used to convert DAMEfinder output into bedgraph files.
